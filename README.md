## How it works

1. Hold the configured hotkey (e.g. Right Option)
2. Speak
3. Release — the transcript is injected at your cursor via simulated paste

Audio is streamed in real-time to [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) for transcription. Optionally, the raw transcript is passed through an LLM ([Groq](https://groq.com) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) for spelling correction, grammar correction, code-mix transliteration, or translation before injection.

## Features

- **Hold-to-record hotkey** — configurable: Right Option, Left Option, Right/Left Command, or Fn (🌐) — same push-to-talk UX as Wispr Flow and Superwhisper
- **Real-time streaming ASR** — powered by Deepgram's WebSocket API (Nova-3, Nova-2, and Whisper models supported)
- **LLM post-processing** — pluggable provider: **Groq** or **OpenRouter** (gives you access to Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama, and 300+ models through a single key)
  - Spelling correction
  - Grammar correction
  - Code-mix transliteration (Hinglish, Tanglish, Spanglish, and 13 more)
  - Translation to any target language
- **Focus Words dictionary** — pin the exact spelling of names / jargon (biased into Deepgram as keyterms) plus `trigger : replacement` text expansions
- **Automatic keyword learning** — type over a dictated word to fix its spelling and SpeechX remembers it as a Focus Word, so it's transcribed right next time ([exact trigger conditions below](#automatic-keyword-learning-type-over))
- **Save & Verify** — Save buttons in Settings immediately validate the key against the provider's `/models` endpoint
- **Surfaced errors** — bad keys, rate limits, and network errors flash on the menu-bar icon and stream to `os_log` (`log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.speechx.app"' --level debug`)
- **Works in any app** — text is injected via simulated Cmd+V into Slack, Notion, VS Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, browser fields, terminals, anything
- **Menu bar app** — no Dock icon, minimal footprint
- **API keys stored in Keychain** — never written to disk in plaintext, never sent to a SpeechX server (there isn't one)
- **Live waveform overlay** while recording so you know it's listening
- **System-audio muting** so your speakers don't bleed into the mic during a meeting

### Automatic keyword learning (type-over)

When you correct the spelling of a word SpeechX just dictated — by **typing over it** — the corrected spelling is added to your **Focus Words** automatically, so the recognizer spells it right next time. Re-spelling the same word **updates** that entry instead of adding a duplicate.

It's deliberately conservative and only triggers when **all** of these hold:

1. **You just dictated it.** The word you edit must be one SpeechX typed in that dictation — editing your own pre-existing text is ignored.
2. **Soon after.** Within ~2 minutes of the dictation (the watch window for that field).
3. **A single-word swap.** Exactly one word is replaced by exactly one other — not multiple edits, and not inserting or deleting words.
4. **A spelling variant, not a different word.** The old and new spellings differ by a small edit distance (1 up to ~⅓ of the word's length), and the corrected word is at least 3 characters long.
5. **Not a common word or homophone.** Everyday words (there/their, your/you're, …) are skipped — this is for names, jargon, and out-of-vocabulary terms.
6. **You pause (~2 s) after finishing.** It waits until you stop typing, so half-typed spellings (e.g. an in-progress `Aysh`) are never learned.
7. **A native text field.** It reads the field via macOS Accessibility, which works in TextEdit, Notes, Mail, and most native apps. Browsers, Electron apps (Slack, VS Code, Discord), and terminals often don't expose editable text, so corrections there may not be picked up.
8. **Accessibility permission is granted** (already required for the hotkey and text injection).

When it fires, the corrected word is added and any older spelling-variants of that same word are removed, leaving a single current entry. Only bare single-word entries are ever auto-removed — your `trigger : replacement` expansions are never touched. It's fully local: SpeechX only compares against the words it injected and keeps just the correction, never the surrounding text of your documents.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or later (Apple Silicon and Intel) — SpeechX itself is **free**
- [Deepgram API key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup) — **free** tier with $200 credit (months of dictation, free)
- One LLM provider key (optional, for post-processing) — both have **free** tiers:
  - [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) — fast, generous **free** tier
  - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) — pay-as-you-go across 300+ models, many **free** models available (`:free` suffix)
- Xcode Command Line Tools or Xcode (only if building from source — also free)

## Installation (Pre-built)

Download the latest `SpeechX.app.zip` or `SpeechX.pkg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page, unzip it, and move it to `/Applications`.

Because SpeechX is not notarized by Apple, macOS will block it on first launch with a *"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"* warning. Run this one-time command to clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SpeechX.app
```

Then open it normally. You will not need to run this again.

> **Why is this needed?** macOS Gatekeeper flags apps downloaded from the internet that aren't signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate. The command above removes that flag — it does not disable any security globally.

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build release .app bundle
./build.sh

# Launch
open SpeechX.app
```

After launch, grant permissions when prompted:
- **Microphone** — for audio capture
- **Accessibility** — for global hotkey detection and text injection

> After every rebuild, you must re-grant Accessibility permission in
> System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.

### Run with logs (for development)

```bash
# Run the binary directly — stdout/stderr appear in the terminal
./SpeechX.app/Contents/MacOS/SpeechX

# Or build a debug binary and run via Swift
swift run

# Stream SpeechX's structured logs (Deepgram + LLM activity, errors)
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.speechx.app"' --level debug
```

## Setup

1. Click the SpeechX icon in the menu bar → **Settings**
2. Paste your **Deepgram API key** and click **Save & Verify** — the key is validated against `/v1/models` immediately
3. Choose a model and language
4. (Optional) In **LLM Post-Processing**, pick **Groq** or **OpenRouter**, paste the matching key, and click **Save & Verify**
5. Pick an LLM model and toggle the corrections / features you want
6. Choose your preferred hotkey
7. Start dictating

## Use cases

- **Engineers** — dictate commit messages, PR descriptions, Slack updates, and prompts to Cursor / Claude Code / ChatGPT three times faster than typing
- **Writers and researchers** — draft into Notion, Obsidian, Bear, or Google Docs without touching the keyboard
- **Multilingual users** — speak Hinglish/Tanglish/Spanglish and get clean Latin-script output, or speak in your native language and have it translated on the fly
- **Accessibility** — a free, hotkey-driven dictation surface for anyone who finds typing painful
- **Founders / sales / support** — knock out email and CRM replies in a fraction of the time

## Adding a new LLM provider

`LLMService.swift` is OpenAI-compatible. To add another provider (Together AI, Anyscale, Fireworks, a self-hosted llama.cpp, etc.) just add a case to the `LLMProvider` enum with its base URL, signup URL, and Keychain key. The Settings UI and HotkeyManager pick it up automatically.

## Privacy

- SpeechX has no backend. There is no SpeechX server, no telemetry, no analytics.
- Audio is streamed **directly from your Mac to Deepgram** over WSS. Transcripts are sent **directly to Groq or OpenRouter** over HTTPS.
- API keys live in the macOS Keychain.
- Source is MIT-licensed and auditable — verify the claims above for yourself.
